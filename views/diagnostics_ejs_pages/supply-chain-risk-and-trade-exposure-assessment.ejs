<h1>9. Supply Chain Risk and Trade Exposure Assessment</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>The Supply Chain Risk and Trade Exposure Assessment evaluates the vulnerability of an organization’s supply chain and procurement activities to external risks such as tariffs, geopolitical instability, trade regulations, supplier concentration, and logistics disruptions. It quantifies exposure to trade-related cost volatility and supply continuity risk, enabling proactive mitigation strategies and smarter sourcing decisions.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use this diagnostic when supply chains are exposed to global trade tensions, commodity volatility, or geopolitical instability. It’s particularly useful for companies with significant offshore manufacturing, global supplier bases, or exposure to regulated materials. Clients benefit by identifying high-risk nodes in the supply chain, developing mitigation plans, and making more resilient and cost-effective sourcing decisions.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Map Global Supply and Procurement Footprint
Identify all key suppliers by region and product category. Map locations of Tier 1 suppliers and, where possible, critical Tier 2/3 dependencies. Overlay logistics hubs, ports, and trade routes.</p>
<p>Step 2: Quantify Trade and Tariff Exposure
Match materials or components to relevant HS codes and assess exposure to tariffs or import duties across major jurisdictions. Incorporate free trade agreement (FTA) eligibility and country-of-origin rules.</p>
<p>Step 3: Evaluate Supplier Risk Profiles
Assess concentration risk (single-source or country dependency), financial stability, political/geopolitical risk in supplier regions, and historical delivery performance.</p>
<p>Step 4: Analyze Regulatory and Compliance Risks
Identify exposure to international trade controls, customs compliance issues, and ESG or labor practice scrutiny that could disrupt supplier relationships or customer demand.</p>
<p>Step 5: Model Risk Scenarios and Cost Impact
Run simulations of potential disruption events (e.g., new tariffs, trade bans, port closures). Quantify cost impact under various scenarios using landed cost models.</p>
<p>Step 6: Recommend Mitigation and Sourcing Strategies
Propose mitigation actions such as alternate sourcing, nearshoring, dual-sourcing, FTA optimization, and supplier diversification. Suggest monitoring tools for ongoing risk detection.</p>
