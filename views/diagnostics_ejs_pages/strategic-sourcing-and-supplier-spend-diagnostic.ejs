<h1>8. Strategic Sourcing and Supplier Spend Diagnostic</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>The Strategic Sourcing and Supplier Spend Diagnostic is designed to evaluate an organization’s external spend profile, vendor landscape, and procurement practices. It identifies opportunities to consolidate suppliers, renegotiate contracts, reduce maverick spend, and increase compliance and savings through more strategic sourcing. The diagnostic also highlights how procurement can shift from tactical buying to a value-adding strategic function.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use this diagnostic during cost-saving initiatives, procurement function transformations, ERP rollouts, or supplier rationalization programs. It’s particularly valuable for organizations with fragmented vendor bases, inconsistent procurement practices, or recent M&A activity. Clients benefit through improved supplier leverage, lower procurement costs, increased compliance, and greater alignment of spend with business goals.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Collect and Clean Spend Data
Gather 12–24 months of accounts payable and procurement data, categorized by supplier, category, business unit, and geography. Standardize supplier names and normalize cost types.</p>
<p>Step 2: Perform Spend Cube Analysis
Build a 3-dimensional “spend cube” (by vendor, category, business unit) to identify concentrations, fragmentation, and off-contract spend. Classify spend as direct, indirect, or services.</p>
<p>Step 3: Segment and Prioritize Suppliers
Categorize vendors based on total spend, strategic importance, risk exposure, and potential for consolidation. Highlight high-fragmentation categories (e.g., office supplies, logistics, MRO).</p>
<p>Step 4: Benchmark Pricing and Terms
Compare pricing and contract terms against external benchmarks, internal variances, and best-in-class practices. Identify categories where pricing or terms are suboptimal.</p>
<p>Step 5: Identify Strategic Sourcing Opportunities
Recommend sourcing events (e.g., RFPs), vendor consolidation, contract renegotiations, and category-specific playbooks (e.g., volume bundling, rebate structuring, payment term optimization).</p>
<p>Step 6: Design Procurement Operating Model Enhancements
Propose changes to organizational structure, technology use (e.g., e-sourcing platforms), approval workflows, and procurement governance to embed discipline and visibility.</p>
