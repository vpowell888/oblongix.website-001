<h1>20. SKU Margin Intelligence and Rationalization Framework</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>The SKU Margin Intelligence and Rationalization Framework is a diagnostic tool that assesses the profitability, velocity, and strategic relevance of individual SKUs across categories and channels. It identifies unprofitable or redundant products, highlights high-margin growth candidates, and guides data-driven SKU rationalization or line extensions. This diagnostic empowers organizations to simplify product portfolios, reduce working capital, and enhance category profitability.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use this diagnostic when facing SKU proliferation, margin compression, high inventory holding costs, or product complexity in operations. Itâ€™s especially valuable in consumer goods, retail, distribution, and manufacturing businesses where product lines have grown unchecked or are misaligned with demand. Clients benefit by eliminating low-value SKUs, freeing up shelf space and working capital, and focusing resources on higher-return products.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Collect SKU-Level Financial and Operational Data
Gather data on net sales, gross margin, inventory turnover, return rates, and supply chain costs by SKU across all channels and regions. Include promotional lift and cannibalization history if available.</p>
<p>Step 2: Segment SKUs Based on Profitability and Velocity
Classify SKUs by margin tiers and sales velocity (e.g., A/B/C analysis). Identify high-volume, low-margin items vs. low-volume, high-margin niche SKUs. Highlight "long tail" SKUs with low movement and low profitability.</p>
<p>Step 3: Calculate Total Cost-to-Serve per SKU
Include hidden costs such as warehousing, handling, packaging variation, vendor lead time variability, and customer service burden to understand true SKU-level profitability.</p>
<p>Step 4: Identify Redundancies and Cannibalization
Analyze product cannibalization and overlap across variants, sizes, and bundles. Identify opportunities to consolidate or delist SKUs without impacting revenue.</p>
<p>Step 5: Align SKU Strategy to Brand and Channel Goals
Map SKUs to their strategic role (e.g., traffic driver, brand builder, profit generator). Flag SKUs that do not support core positioning or underperform in priority channels.</p>
<p>Step 6: Recommend Rationalization and Optimization Actions
Propose SKU retirements, bundling strategies, pricing optimization, or line expansions based on profitability, consumer behavior, and production efficiency.</p>
<p>Step 7: Build Governance and Tracking Tools
Establish recurring SKU review processes and dashboards for monitoring SKU health metrics. Integrate recommendations into assortment planning and product development cycles.</p>
