<h1>35. Effective Tax Rate (ETR) Optimization and Forecasting Model</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>This diagnostic analyzes a company's current effective tax rate and its drivers — including geographic income mix, tax credits, deductions, and transfer pricing — to identify opportunities to reduce tax burden and improve cash tax forecasting accuracy. It also models the impact of strategic decisions (e.g., restructuring, M&A) on future ETR.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use during tax planning, global footprint evaluations, M&A, or budget cycles. Clients benefit by identifying ETR drivers, reducing tax volatility, and incorporating tax strategy into financial planning.</p>
<p>3. Steps</p>
<p>Gather consolidated and jurisdictional tax data</p>
<p>Map ETR contributors (statutory vs. book tax differences)</p>
<p>Model forecasted income by jurisdiction</p>
<p>Simulate impact of restructuring, intercompany pricing, or credits</p>
<p>Recommend tax planning levers (e.g., IP migration, BEPS alignment)</p>
<p>Build ETR dashboard for scenario planning</p>
<p>4. Data Sources</p>
<p>Internal tax provision files</p>
<p>Jurisdictional income and tax return data</p>
<p>Transfer pricing documentation</p>
<p>Forecasts and long-range plans</p>
