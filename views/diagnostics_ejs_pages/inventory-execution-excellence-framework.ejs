<h1>2. Inventory Execution Excellence Framework</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>The Inventory Execution Excellence Framework provides a structured, end-to-end roadmap for implementing inventory optimisation initiatives. It moves beyond diagnostics and into tactical execution, detailing how to translate insights into measurable impact across operations, procurement, planning, and warehousing. This framework ensures that inventory decisions are operationalized in a disciplined, data-driven manner across the value chain.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use this framework when a company has already identified inventory inefficiencies or opportunities through diagnostic tools but needs to move into the “how” of execution. It’s particularly useful in post-merger integration, supply chain redesigns, ERP migrations, or cost-reduction programs. Clients benefit by ensuring that inventory optimisation is not just theoretical but embedded in processes and tools, leading to sustainable results and alignment across functions.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Align on Strategy and Inventory Targets
Establish business-wide objectives for inventory levels, working capital, and service level. Define what "optimised inventory" looks like for different business units, geographies, and product types.</p>
<p>Step 2: Conduct SKU Segmentation and Classification
Segment SKUs using ABC or XYZ analysis based on value, volatility, and criticality. Tailor inventory policies to each segment (e.g., higher safety stock for strategic A items; leaner approaches for C items).</p>
<p>Step 3: Map Current Replenishment and Ordering Processes
Identify how inventory levels are currently planned, ordered, and reviewed. Document reorder points, lead times, batch sizes, and frequency of review cycles to find inefficiencies or inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Step 4: Redesign Policies and Parameters
Using demand forecasting and lead time variability, recalibrate inventory policies (e.g., min/max settings, safety stock buffers, EOQ adjustments). Design exception rules for promotional, seasonal, or high-risk items.</p>
<p>Step 5: Embed Changes in Systems and Workflows
Implement new inventory logic in ERP or planning systems. Modify master data inputs, and automate triggers for replenishment. Align KPIs in dashboards to new targets and policies.</p>
<p>Step 6: Cross-Functional Governance and Change Management
Create cross-departmental inventory councils (e.g., Ops, Finance, Sales) to govern decisions and resolve trade-offs. Train teams on new policies and embed process changes into SOPs.</p>
<p>Step 7: Track, Monitor, and Course Correct
Establish dashboards to track fill rates, turnover, inventory days, and forecast accuracy. Perform root-cause analyses on exceptions and refine parameters periodically.</p>
