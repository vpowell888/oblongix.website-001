<h1>6. Lean G&A Performance Benchmark</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>The Lean G&A Performance Benchmark assesses the cost-effectiveness and structural efficiency of General & Administrative (G&A) functions such as Finance, HR, IT, Legal, and Procurement. It benchmarks a company’s G&A spend and staffing levels against industry peers and best-in-class operators to identify cost-saving opportunities, efficiency gaps, and areas for process automation or organizational redesign.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use this diagnostic during cost-reduction initiatives, post-merger integration, zero-based budgeting exercises, or when preparing for a transformation of back-office operations. It’s especially relevant for companies with rapidly scaling SG&A costs or pressure to improve EBITDA margins. Clients benefit by uncovering excessive spend, identifying automation opportunities, and aligning functional costs with business priorities and complexity.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Gather Internal G&A Cost and Headcount Data
Collect detailed cost and FTE data by function (Finance, HR, IT, etc.) and sub-function. Normalize for one-time items or non-operational costs (e.g., restructuring).</p>
<p>Step 2: Classify and Standardize G&A Spend
Map spend to standardized categories using a functional taxonomy. Ensure consistent treatment across regions and business units for accurate benchmarking.</p>
<p>Step 3: Benchmark Against Peers and Industry Leaders
Compare cost as a percentage of revenue, cost per employee, and FTEs per 1,000 employees to internal goals and external benchmarks (by industry, company size, geography).</p>
<p>Step 4: Identify Gaps and Performance Outliers
Pinpoint functions or sub-functions with above-average spend, fragmented processes, or unusually high labor intensity. Highlight variances between business units or geographies.</p>
<p>Step 5: Diagnose Root Causes
Investigate drivers of inefficiency — such as duplicated roles, excessive customization, manual processes, or outdated systems. Identify potential for consolidation, shared services, or outsourcing.</p>
<p>Step 6: Recommend Efficiency Levers and Redesigns
Propose targeted actions such as automation (e.g., RPA in Finance), shared services models, role rationalization, or digital self-service in HR. Model cost savings and implementation timelines.</p>
