<h1>10. Cost to Serve Diagnostic</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>The Customer Profitability & Service Cost Diagnostic uncovers the true cost of serving different customer segments, channels, and order profiles by analyzing the full range of activities required to fulfill and support those customers. It isolates the hidden costs embedded in service models — such as shipping, returns, customization, or account management — and calculates profit at the customer or segment level to inform pricing, service tiering, and go-to-market strategies.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use this diagnostic when there is unexplained margin erosion, increasing cost-to-serve variability, or a desire to optimize pricing and service strategies. It’s particularly valuable in B2B or omni-channel businesses with complex customer service models. Clients benefit by identifying unprofitable customers, reducing margin leakage, and making smarter trade-offs between service and cost.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Gather End-to-End Cost and Revenue Data by Customer
Collect revenue and gross margin data alongside cost elements including order processing, warehousing, delivery, returns, sales support, discounts, and custom handling by customer or segment.</p>
<p>Step 2: Build Activity-Based Costing Model
Map activities (e.g., order entry, picking, delivery, invoicing) to cost pools and assign costs to customers based on usage patterns (e.g., orders per month, delivery frequency, return rates).</p>
<p>Step 3: Segment Customers Based on Profitability Profiles
Categorize customers into high-margin, low-margin, and value-dilutive tiers. Identify key drivers of service cost and whether those are recoverable through pricing or operational changes.</p>
<p>Step 4: Identify Value-Destroying Behaviors or Policies
Analyze policies such as unrestricted returns, small-batch deliveries, manual order handling, or free expedited shipping that increase cost-to-serve.</p>
<p>Step 5: Recommend Service Differentiation or Pricing Actions
Propose strategies such as minimum order thresholds, service tiering, delivery frequency optimization, or pricing realignment to reflect true service costs.</p>
<p>Step 6: Align Go-To-Market Strategy with Cost Profiles
Recommend adjustments to sales and marketing focus based on profitability tiers — e.g., targeting more profitable segments or restructuring sales incentives.</p>
