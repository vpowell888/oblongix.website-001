<h1>12. Freight Margin Recovery and Logistics Cost Efficiency Diagnostic</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>The Freight Margin Recovery and Logistics Cost Efficiency Diagnostic evaluates a company’s shipping and freight cost structures, cost recovery mechanisms, and logistics strategy to identify opportunities for margin recovery and operational savings. It focuses on both reducing freight-related expenses and ensuring that logistics costs are accurately passed through or priced into customer contracts, particularly in B2B and omni-channel environments.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use this diagnostic when freight costs are rising disproportionately to revenue, when customer shipping charges are not covering true logistics costs, or when renegotiating third-party logistics (3PL) contracts. It’s especially valuable for companies offering free or subsidized shipping, or managing a mix of parcel, LTL, and full truckload services. Clients benefit by improving freight margin recovery, reducing cost-to-serve, and renegotiating supplier contracts to align with business scale and complexity.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Collect Freight Spend and Recovery Data
Aggregate freight costs by mode (e.g., parcel, LTL, FTL), region, carrier, and customer. Match against freight charges invoiced or recovered from customers to identify margin gaps.</p>
<p>Step 2: Map Freight Terms and Recovery Policies
Review contractual freight terms (e.g., FOB origin/destination, prepaid/add) and internal billing policies for freight charges. Identify inconsistencies across customer types or channels.</p>
<p>Step 3: Analyze Carrier Mix, Pricing, and Utilization
Evaluate routing guide compliance, mode optimization, carrier selection patterns, and service-level adherence. Benchmark pricing versus market rates or historical performance.</p>
<p>Step 4: Segment Customers by Freight Margin Impact
Classify customers by shipping behavior (e.g., order frequency, ship-to locations, order size) and identify high-cost, low-recovery segments. Evaluate where pricing or policies need adjustment.</p>
<p>Step 5: Identify Margin Recovery and Efficiency Levers
Recommend strategies such as freight cost pass-through, fuel surcharge updates, order consolidation, minimum order quantities, or threshold-based free shipping policies.</p>
<p>Step 6: Optimize Carrier Contracts and 3PL Relationships
Renegotiate terms with logistics providers based on volume, performance metrics, and service tier requirements. Explore alternative modes or regional carriers for cost savings.</p>
<p>Step 7: Integrate Freight Metrics into Pricing and Finance
Build freight cost allocation into customer-level P&Ls or cost-to-serve models. Create visibility through dashboards and enforce policies through quoting and invoicing systems.</p>
