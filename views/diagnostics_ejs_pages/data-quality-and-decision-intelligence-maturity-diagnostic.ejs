<h1>44. Data Quality and Decision Intelligence Maturity Diagnostic</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>The Data Quality and Decision Intelligence Maturity Diagnostic evaluates the accuracy, consistency, and usability of enterprise data as it relates to decision-making. It identifies root causes of poor data trust, misaligned data governance, and ineffective analytics workflows â€” all of which erode strategic decision velocity and accuracy. This diagnostic supports the creation of a roadmap for building a reliable, insight-driven organization.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use this diagnostic when leadership lacks confidence in reporting, when data conflicts exist across functions, or when data strategy lags digital transformation goals. It is especially relevant during ERP or analytics platform modernization, or when building a data governance function. Clients benefit by eliminating decision-making friction, improving cross-functional alignment, and building a more data-literate culture.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Map Key Decision Processes and Data Inputs
Identify high-impact decisions (e.g., pricing, inventory planning, customer targeting) and trace the data flows that support them. Highlight where decisions are delayed or debated due to conflicting data.</p>
<p>Step 2: Assess Data Quality Dimensions Across Sources
Evaluate completeness, accuracy, timeliness, and consistency of critical datasets (e.g., product master, customer, finance, vendor). Identify systems with frequent rework or overrides.</p>
<p>Step 3: Analyze Data Lineage and Integration
Trace how data moves from source systems to dashboards or models. Identify manual handoffs, conflicting definitions, or misaligned hierarchies that undermine trust.</p>
<p>Step 4: Evaluate Data Governance and Ownership Structures
Assess whether clear data ownership, stewardship, and quality monitoring exist across key domains. Check for a central data governance body and metadata standards.</p>
<p>Step 5: Benchmark Analytics and Reporting Maturity
Review analytics tool usage, BI adoption, self-service enablement, and dashboard reliability. Compare decision-making speed and data confidence across departments.</p>
<p>Step 6: Identify Root Causes and Recommend Improvements
Recommend changes to data architecture, stewardship roles, master data management, and decision support systems. Prioritize fixes by impact on decision quality.</p>
<p>Step 7: Build a Maturity Roadmap and Governance Model
Use a data and decision intelligence maturity model to assess current state and define target state. Recommend steps for process standardization, tech enablement, and cultural change.</p>
