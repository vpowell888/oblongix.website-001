<h1>1. Inventory Optimisation</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>Inventory Optimisation is a diagnostic used to assess the efficiency and balance of inventory levels across a company's supply chain. It identifies overstock, understock, and slow-moving items, and provides actionable recommendations to reduce carrying costs while improving product availability and service levels.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use this diagnostic when a company faces high inventory holding costs, frequent stockouts, or excessive working capital tied up in inventory. It’s especially beneficial during periods of demand volatility, supply chain disruption, or strategic transformation (e.g., SKU rationalization or footprint changes). Clients benefit by freeing up cash, reducing write-offs, and enhancing customer satisfaction through better product availability.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Assess Current Inventory Profiles: Segment SKUs by location, product category, and turnover rate (e.g., ABC analysis).</p>
<p>Calculate Key Metrics: Determine inventory days, turnover ratio, service level, stockout frequency, and obsolescence rate.</p>
<p>Evaluate Demand Patterns: Analyze historical sales data to identify demand variability and seasonality.</p>
<p>Benchmark Against Peers: Compare inventory metrics to industry or competitor benchmarks to identify inefficiencies.</p>
<p>Classify Inventory: Use classification frameworks (e.g., Make-to-Stock vs. Make-to-Order, critical vs. non-critical) to prioritize actions.</p>
<p>Model Optimization Scenarios: Simulate changes in reorder points, safety stock levels, and lot sizes using demand variability and lead time data.</p>
<p>Define Reduction Targets: Set goals for working capital release and inventory reduction while maintaining or improving service levels.</p>
<p>Develop Action Plan: Recommend specific actions such as vendor lead time reduction, SKU rationalization, improved forecasting, or buffer stock policies.</p>
