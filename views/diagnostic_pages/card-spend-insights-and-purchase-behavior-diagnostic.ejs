<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Acquire and Segment Card Transaction Data
Work with card data providers (e.g., Mastercard Advisors, Visa Analytics, or third-party aggregators) to obtain anonymized, aggregated spend data by geography, category, and merchant type.</p>
<p>Step 2: Analyze Share of Wallet and Purchase Frequency
Compare client’s share of customer spend within relevant categories (e.g., dining, apparel, personal care) to competitors. Track visit frequency, spend per trip, and cardholder loyalty over time.</p>
<p>Step 3: Identify Cross-Shopping and Competitor Leakage
Assess how often customers who shop at the client’s locations also shop with direct competitors. Highlight category overlaps, time-of-day preferences, and regional switching behavior.</p>
<p>Step 4: Segment Customers by Spend Behavior
Group customers based on transaction history into segments like high-frequency/low-value, occasional high spenders, or seasonal buyers. Tailor messaging and offers accordingly.</p>
<p>Step 5: Overlay Demographic and Location Insights
Combine spend data with demographic proxies and location signals to understand how customer behavior varies by region, age, income, or urban vs. suburban settings.</p>
<p>Step 6: Recommend Targeted Growth Levers
Suggest loyalty program enhancements, precision promotions, or localized pricing strategies based on spend trends. Identify gaps in channel penetration (e.g., e-commerce vs. in-store).</p>
<p>Step 7: Build Competitive and Behavioral Dashboards
Create dashboards to track competitive share shifts, regional trends, and campaign performance across key customer segments and geographies.</p>
