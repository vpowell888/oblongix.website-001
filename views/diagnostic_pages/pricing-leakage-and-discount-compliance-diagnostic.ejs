<h1>46. Pricing Leakage and Discount Compliance Diagnostic</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>The Pricing Leakage and Discount Compliance Diagnostic identifies where margin is lost due to inconsistent pricing, unauthorized discounts, under-enforced policies, and pricing exceptions that are not value-justified. It provides a clear view of how pricing decisions deviate from policy across sales teams, regions, and customer segments — and recommends controls to tighten revenue capture and reduce margin erosion.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use this diagnostic when margins are shrinking despite stable costs, when discounting policies are inconsistently applied, or when pricing control is decentralized. It’s particularly relevant in B2B, enterprise sales, or any business using negotiated pricing. Clients benefit by recovering lost margin, enforcing pricing discipline, and improving deal quality and governance.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Collect Transaction-Level Pricing and Discount Data
Gather line-level invoice, quote, and sales data including list price, net price, discount type, promotional codes, and approval records by customer, product, and sales rep.</p>
<p>Step 2: Compare Actual Prices to List and Floor Prices
Calculate the gap between realized prices and list/floor prices. Flag transactions with excessive or unauthorized discounting, and segment by region, rep, customer type, or product.</p>
<p>Step 3: Analyze Deal Approval Process and Compliance
Assess discounting approval thresholds, workflows, and override frequency. Identify where policies are bypassed or inconsistently applied.</p>
<p>Step 4: Identify Patterns of Pricing Leakage
Segment leakage by customer tier, product type, channel, and geography. Highlight systemic causes such as lack of guardrails, weak sales incentives, or unmanaged exceptions.</p>
<p>Step 5: Quantify Margin Loss and Financial Impact
Calculate the revenue and margin impact of leakage by comparing current pricing behavior to policy-aligned scenarios. Estimate EBITDA uplift from compliance improvements.</p>
<p>Step 6: Recommend Policy, Training, and Tool Enhancements
Suggest improvements to discount governance (deal desks, approval layers), sales compensation alignment, and CPQ (configure-price-quote) system enforcement.</p>
<p>Step 7: Build a Pricing Compliance Dashboard
Create dashboards that visualize pricing integrity, leakage by segment, approval exceptions, and trend analysis. Enable real-time alerts for policy breaches or high-risk discounts.</p>
