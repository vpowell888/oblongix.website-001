<h1>45. Total Workforce Cost and Productivity Optimization Diagnostic</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>The Total Workforce Cost and Productivity Optimization Diagnostic provides a holistic view of all labor-related costs — including full-time employees, part-time staff, contingent workers, and outsourced roles — and links them to output and value creation. It identifies inefficiencies, overstaffed functions, underutilized skills, and opportunities for labor cost reduction or workforce strategy realignment.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use this diagnostic when labor costs are rising faster than revenue, when organizations are considering restructuring or automation, or when productivity metrics are unclear. It’s particularly useful during cost-transformation programs, zero-based budgeting, or operating model redesign. Clients benefit by aligning workforce spend with strategic priorities, improving output per dollar, and building scalable workforce plans.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Gather Comprehensive Workforce Cost Data
Collect salary, benefits, contractor spend, temporary labor, third-party service costs, and training investments across all business units. Include externalized labor via outsourcing contracts.</p>
<p>Step 2: Map Workforce by Role Type, Function, and Cost Center
Segment workforce into value streams (e.g., customer-facing, support, innovation), functions, and cost centers. Map headcount and cost by FTE, contractor, and outsourced headcount.</p>
<p>Step 3: Analyze Output and Productivity by Function
Assess output metrics (e.g., revenue per FTE, transactions per agent, units per labor hour) by team. Normalize for workload and business complexity.</p>
<p>Step 4: Benchmark Against Industry and Internal Best Practices
Compare labor cost ratios, productivity metrics, and span of control benchmarks to peers. Identify overstaffed or underperforming areas relative to business model norms.</p>
<p>Step 5: Evaluate Workforce Flexibility and Mix
Assess labor model flexibility — contractor usage, shift structures, offshoring, and reskilling agility. Identify over-reliance on fixed cost or inflexible talent pools.</p>
<p>Step 6: Identify Efficiency Levers and Strategic Realignments
Recommend labor cost reduction options (e.g., automation, RPA, GBS adoption), as well as redeployment and upskilling for future-fit roles. Highlight areas for selective investment or reduction.</p>
<p>Step 7: Build a Workforce Optimization Dashboard
Create a workforce cost and productivity dashboard with drill-downs by function, geography, and role type. Enable scenario modeling and forecasting to support CFO and CHRO planning.</p>
