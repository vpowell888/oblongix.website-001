<h1>7. Network Footprint Optimization Model</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>The Network Footprint Optimization Model is a diagnostic framework used to evaluate the current configuration of manufacturing plants and distribution centers. It identifies opportunities to consolidate, relocate, or resize facilities in order to reduce logistics costs, improve service levels, and align capacity with demand. This model is critical for optimizing total landed cost, improving responsiveness, and simplifying supply chain complexity.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use this diagnostic when a company is experiencing rising logistics or operating costs, excess capacity, service level failures, or undergoing a supply chain transformation (e.g., reshoring, M&A integration). It is also valuable when entering new markets or planning for demand shifts. Clients benefit by unlocking structural cost savings, improving lead times, and future-proofing their supply network against disruption and growth.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Map the Current Network
Document all manufacturing plants, warehouses, and distribution centers, including location, capacity, throughput, fixed and variable costs, and headcount.</p>
<p>Step 2: Analyze Flows and Service Levels
Map the product and material flows between nodes and to customers. Measure lead times, service levels, fill rates, and transportation costs by route and facility.</p>
<p>Step 3: Calculate Facility-Level Economics
Break down the cost structure of each site (e.g., per-unit cost, fixed overhead, labor intensity, utilization). Identify underutilized or high-cost facilities.</p>
<p>Step 4: Evaluate Constraints and Requirements
Consider regulatory requirements, union agreements, customer SLAs, and product-specific constraints (e.g., perishability, hazardous materials).</p>
<p>Step 5: Run Optimization Scenarios
Use modeling tools to simulate consolidation options based on objectives like cost minimization, service-level maximization, or carbon footprint reduction. Identify optimal location configurations and expected savings.</p>
<p>Step 6: Develop Consolidation Roadmap
Build a phased implementation plan including facility exit/entry timing, transition costs, employee implications, capital investment needs, and customer communication strategies.</p>
