<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Collect Sales and Operational Performance Data
Gather ASIN-level data on revenue, units sold, conversion rates, Buy Box percentage, stockouts, return rates, and advertising spend. Include both 1P and 3P data if applicable.</p>
<p>Step 2: Benchmark Product Visibility and Ranking
Evaluate organic and paid ranking for key search terms using tools like Helium 10, Jungle Scout, or DataHawk. Compare to competitor ASINs and identify where visibility is lagging.</p>
<p>Step 3: Audit Product Detail Pages (PDPs)
Assess content quality (images, bullets, A+ content), keyword optimization, reviews, and pricing competitiveness. Score listings using Amazon’s best practices for conversion.</p>
<p>Step 4: Analyze Advertising Efficiency and Share of Voice
Review ROAS, ACOS, click-through rate, and impression share by campaign. Identify wasted ad spend, under-indexed terms, and opportunities for improved targeting or budget allocation.</p>
<p>Step 5: Map Competitive Landscape
Identify direct competitors by category and analyze pricing, reviews, content quality, and promotional cadence. Evaluate barriers to entry, white space, and aggressive share tactics.</p>
<p>Step 6: Identify Levers for Growth and Profitability
Recommend actions like enhanced content, Subscribe & Save enrollment, bundle creation, ad reallocation, review strategy improvement, and inventory planning to prevent stockouts.</p>
