<h1>42. Resilience and Business Continuity Risk Exposure Diagnostic</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>The Resilience and Business Continuity Risk Exposure Diagnostic evaluates an organizationâ€™s preparedness for operational disruptions, external shocks, and business continuity challenges. It identifies critical vulnerabilities across supply chain, technology, facilities, and workforce operations, and models the potential financial and operational impact of various disruption scenarios. The diagnostic supports enterprise-wide risk mitigation planning and investment prioritization.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use this diagnostic when supply chains are unstable, cyber threats are increasing, natural disasters or geopolitical tensions are emerging, or when clients face investor or regulatory scrutiny around resilience planning. It is particularly useful during enterprise risk assessments, post-crisis reviews, or when building ESG-linked risk disclosures. Clients benefit by quantifying exposure, validating contingency plans, and improving risk-adjusted decision-making.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Identify Critical Business Processes and Dependencies
Map end-to-end value chains, IT systems, facilities, and third parties required to deliver key products or services. Identify critical nodes and dependencies.</p>
<p>Step 2: Assess Historical Disruption Events and Response Maturity
Review past disruptions (e.g., outages, natural disasters, supply shortages) and how quickly the business recovered. Evaluate documented business continuity plans (BCPs) and business impact assessments (BIAs).</p>
<p>Step 3: Evaluate Risk Exposure by Threat Type
Assess exposure to external threats including cyberattacks, supply shortages, labor actions, climate events, and geopolitical risks. Score by likelihood and severity.</p>
<p>Step 4: Quantify Operational and Financial Impact Scenarios
Model the potential cost and recovery time of major disruption scenarios using scenario planning or Monte Carlo simulations. Include revenue loss, opex, reputational damage, and customer attrition.</p>
<p>Step 5: Review BCP Coverage and Mitigation Readiness
Evaluate how well current continuity plans address priority risks, and whether they are tested regularly. Check governance, escalation protocols, and team readiness.</p>
<p>Step 6: Benchmark Resilience Capabilities and Maturity
Compare capabilities to leading frameworks (e.g., ISO 22301, NIST, COSO ERM) and peer practices. Identify gaps in redundancy, geographic diversification, or response automation.</p>
<p>Step 7: Recommend Risk Mitigation and Contingency Investments
Propose mitigations such as dual-sourcing, cloud redundancy, business continuity automation, or supply network redesign. Prioritize by impact and readiness score.</p>
