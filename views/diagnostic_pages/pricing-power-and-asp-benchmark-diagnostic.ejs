<h1>32. Pricing Power and ASP Benchmark Diagnostic</h1>
<h2 id="description">1. Description</h2>
<p>The Pricing Power and ASP Benchmark Diagnostic evaluates a company’s average selling price (ASP) across products, customer segments, and channels, and compares performance to competitors and market expectations. It identifies pricing strengths and weaknesses, analyzes drivers of ASP changes over time, and supports data-backed pricing strategy design. The diagnostic reveals how well a company is monetizing its offering and whether it is leaving value on the table.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use">2. When to Use</h2>
<p>Use this diagnostic during pricing strategy reviews, commercial due diligence, product repositioning, or when evaluating discounting, promotion, or mix impacts. It’s especially valuable in commoditized, fast-moving, or multi-tiered pricing environments. Clients benefit by uncovering margin leakage, understanding competitive positioning, and optimizing pricing architecture for growth and profitability.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-explanation-of-what-to-do">3. Detailed Explanation of What to Do</h2>
<p>Step 1: Collect and Normalize ASP Data
Calculate average selling price by SKU, product family, customer segment, and channel. Adjust for promotions, discounts, and returns to get net ASP.</p>
<p>Step 2: Benchmark Against Competitors and Industry Averages
Use third-party price scraping tools, industry pricing surveys, and publicly available data to compare ASPs across similar product categories and geographies.</p>
<p>Step 3: Analyze ASP Drivers Over Time
Decompose ASP changes into mix, pricing, discounting, and promotional effects. Determine whether ASP growth is due to premiumization, product evolution, or inflation.</p>
<p>Step 4: Identify High- and Low-Performing Pricing Zones
Spot SKUs or segments with significant price variability or underperformance. Flag inconsistencies across geographies or customer types that suggest pricing discipline issues.</p>
<p>Step 5: Evaluate Pricing Power and Elasticity
Assess where the brand can command premium pricing due to differentiation or brand equity. Conduct price elasticity analysis to guide price increases or bundling strategies.</p>
<p>Step 6: Recommend Pricing Optimization Levers
Propose actions such as price floor enforcement, dynamic pricing, tiered pricing models, bundling, and value-based pricing for high-margin SKUs or segments.</p>
<p>Step 7: Build ASP Dashboards for Ongoing Management
Create dashboards showing ASP trends, pricing leakage, regional differences, and price-volume correlations. Use them to guide commercial policy and price governance.</p>
